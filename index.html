                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>I entered the Electrical Power Engineering specialization. I did not understand what I would do in the future. But one day everything changed. We were offered to work with FESTO training stands (conveyors, pneumatics, ROBOT-MANIPULATOR!). I have felt indescribable delight at the result of MY first code. It started the conveyor when a part appears in front of the sensor. I have been working in the industry for 5 years, but the excitement of observing the automated operations did not pass. I love when things work by themselves with little or no direct human control. And this applies not only to industrial equipment. It can be a robot vacuum cleaner, air conditioner, script, or a mobile app with reminders.</p>
                <p>Most of my working time I maintenance automation systems. I do not only eliminate the consequences of faults/errors. My philosophy is to prevent faults/errors by analyzing information and modernizing control systems. In my projects, the main principle is Automation should bring the most benefit to the customer and be as reliable as possible. When designing I rely on Mitsubishi products (PLC / HMI / VFD) and Siemens (SCADA). But I am able to work with automation devices from many manufacturers.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I devote my time to my family and my hobbies. One of them is training. I enjoy the process and it is also very good for my health. A few evenings a week I spend my time watching soccer (Glory Glory Man United!) or professional wrestling (AEW/NJPW) or playing video games. I like to read a good book before a night, preferably fantasy like Sapkowski, Glen Cook or professional literature like Bill Hollifield. Aside from daily hobbies, on any vacation, my wife and I love to travel to other cities and countries.</p>

                    <p>My first paid full-time job. Like everyone else, I started by replacing broken sensors/heaters and setting up inkjet printers for cable marking. After a while, I began to work on the installation and tuning of VFDs. Later I moved on to studying cable production lines PLC / HMI / SCADA programs and projects. Sometimes I made small changes to the code. There were also small own projects. The scale of the plant (the part where I worked) is approximately 1300 D(I/O) / A(I/O) signals. The plant uses a very wide range of automation devices and from different manufacturers. I wish I had enough time to work with all devices (eg Panasonic servos).<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyMAkKLCEvY" title="KAZCENTRELECTROPROVOD LLP promo video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video about KAZCENTRELECTROPROVOD LLP</a><br><br>Technologies I worked with here: Delta VFDs A / B / E / M series (+VFDsoft), YASKAWA VFDs A1000/V1000 series (+DriveWizard), Siemens PLCs S7-200 / 200Smart / 300 (+STEP 7/STEP 7 MicroWin), Mitsubishi PLCs FX2N/FX3U (+GX Developer), M2I TOP HMIs (+XDesignerPlus), Delta DOP HMIs (+DOPsoft), WellinTech SCADA Kingview, Profibus DP.</p>

                    <p>My first commercial project outside of maintenance service. 137 DI / DO / AO. 12 VFDs (15 in total) controlled by CC-Link IE Field Basic protocol. The project turned out to be difficult. 16 motors, 14 of which must be speed synchronized. The line in the process of sawing off the sandwich panel should not have stopped movement (flying saw). There was no PLC module for the positioning of the flying saw servo drive (it was not included in the project). An encoder was used that measured the length and linear speed of the line. The servo motor speed was controlled by the PLC analog output (according to the measured line speed). It was necessary to obtain the length of the sandwich panel with an error of less than 5 mm from the specified length. With a panel length of 9 m, the error cannot exceed 0.05%. With sweat and blood, we got an error of no more than 3mm. I developed PLC code and HMI project. Did commissioning work. <br><br><a href=" https://youtu.be/MScc4ZSoeP4" title=" Sandwich Panel Production Line.

In fact, the cutting machine is the same flying saw as in the Stynergy project, only for plastic pipes and works on pneumatics. So I used the same concept. I developed the PLC code and HMI project, did the installation and commissioning work.

                    <p>Commercial project. The goal of the project was to receive data on electrical parameters from 16 VFDs. Mitsubishi VFD only had the RS-485 interface available, so the Modbus RTU protocol was chosen. I used 2 PLCs (8 VFDs each). Outside of the main goal, I also set additional goals for myself to improve my programming skills. The first goal was to implement ALL available network mode functions of the Mitsubishi VFD. For receiving data these are the operating mode, the state of the discrete outputs, analog values (not only electrical parameters, but also, for example, the temperature of the VFD), the model and series of the VFD, the error code (with decoding), VFD parameters values. For sending data, these are writing digital inputs, frequency task, setting VFD parameters, resetting errors. The second goal was to improve my coding skills so that I need less development time in the future. To achieve this, I studied creating and using data structures, using them in arrays, setting up and using auto-filling for memory areas, registering and using system variables to import from PLC to HMI. The third goal was to obtain the most optimized communication algorithm over the Modbus RTU protocol to obtain up-to-date quality data (receive data / writing commands of all 8 inverters in less than 500ms). It was necessary to use each send/request to the maximum and not make useless send/request operations (e.g. send frequency task when the VFD is not running). I developed PLC code and achieved all my and project goals. <br><br>Technologies I worked with here: Mitsubishi PLCs FX3U (+GX Works 2, Melsoft Navigator), VFDs FR-A/F800, Modbus RTU.</p>

                      <div class="jobYears">2018, Nurkazgan, Kazakhstan</div>
                      <p>Nurkazgan Enrichment Plant's SCADA-system was originally my pet project for learning WinCC. It all started by connecting one PLC from the crushing complex and creating a screen displaying the operating status of the conveyors and crushers. Over time, I made trends and a log of alarms, created a screen with setpoints and interlockings, and gradually began to expand the system by adding PLCs of other complexes. This project made work much easier for our maintenance service department. For example, before, to change the temperature setting of the crusher, it was necessary to walk a total of 900 m, now 0 m and a couple of keystrokes. It also became easier to analyze the condition of the equipment for maintenance purposes. You do not need to drive 11 km to the pumping station to get information about pump condition. Pump parameter trends and event logs at your workplace. Over the years, I still sometimes add some objects (currently 13 PLCs and 946 tags) and the system performs its functions properly. But SCADA needs a global rework in accordance with the HMI ISA-101 design standard. Thanks to Realpars.com and PAS's "The High Performance HMI" book for covering this topic. I wish I knew about the existence of the standard a few years ago.<br><br>Technologies I worked with here: Mitsubishi PLCs FX3U (+GX Works 2/GX IEC Developer), MELSOFT MX OPC Server UA, Siemens WinCC 7.(4/5), Ubiquiti APs 5AC Loco / LiteAP AC 120, Zyxel modems P-791R.</p>

                    <p>Commercial project. The goal of the project was to replace old contactors-relays schemes for two stacker machines on a crusher complex of the Nurkazgan Enrichment Plant. The old scheme was unreliable, had frequent malfunctions and it was hard to diagnose. Two machines are identical and consist of a feeder, conveyor, and stacker. Before this project, we already had massive experience with those stackers because they were under our maintenance service. We replaced old equipment with the VFDs and PLC. PLC controls the process and receives all information (Current / Voltage / Frequency /D iscrete statuses / etc) from VFDs via Mitsubishi Inverter Protocol. All the data were added to the crusher complex operator’s HMI via Profibus DP and data started to be logged. As result, Stacker machines' malfunctions decreased to a minimum and in those infrequent cases it is easy to diagnose a problem with help of all indicated and logged data on the HMI. I developed PLC code and made small changes in the HMI project. Did commissioning work.<br><br>Technologies I worked with here: Mitsubishi PLCs FX3U (+GX IEC Developer), VFDs FR-A800, Mitsubishi Inverter Protocol, Profibus DP.</p>

                      <p>In 2018, *some* company made the control system for a new ball mill on Nurkazgan Enrichment Plant. They left behind a system in which it was very difficult to determine the cause of the malfunction if it occurred. PLC is protected by a password, so we decided to make our own indication system for the parameters of the mill. Our system was supposed to work in parallel with the main one and help prevent or eliminate malfunctions. In the system were entered digital signals from the liquid rheostat control system, signals from the 6kV switchgear, signals from the motor brush-lifting control system. Analog signals also were entered for motor current and for bearing and cooling water temperatures. I developed PLC code and HMI project. This system helped us a lot in the maintenance of the ball mill.<br><br>Technologies I worked with here: Mitsubishi PLC FX3U (+GX Works 2), Mitsubishi GT23 HMI (+GT Designer 3).</p>

                  <p>I created a stand from old equipment and materials at hand for training colleagues. The stand consists of a Mitsubishi FR-A800 VFD connected to the FX3U PLC via the Modbus RTU protocol. HMI is Mitsubishi GOT 16. This stand allows you to test any function of the VFD with the receipt of all available information (see "VFDs parameters indication system" project) about VFD operation on the HMI. I developed the PLC code and HMI project, did the installation. <br><br>I filmed training videos about the most important automation systems on the plant — Roller Press and Ball Mill. The overall length of the video is 3 hours 8 minutes. In the video, I talk about the technological process, system architecture, electrical circuit, PLC algorithm operation. Also, share experiences on faults that occurred in the past. Describe how to quickly diagnose and fix the problem.</p>

                      <p>I implemented measurement and display of the length of the produced cable and linear speed on two production lines. Before this, line operators relied on the length marks, printed on the cable. The printer works completely autonomously. I used a discrete sensor connected to the high-speed inputs of the PLC. The sensor was detecting the teeth of a part bolted to the gearbox shaft of the wheel capstan machine. Then I made a code with simple math for length and used the SPD operator built into the Mitsubishi PLC for line speed. Made changes to the HMI. For a more accurate measurement, it is better to use an encoder, but since we did not have an extra encoder and the line speed is low enough, I used an inductive sensor. <br><br>Technologies I worked with here: Mitsubishi PLCs FX2N (+GX Developer), M2I TOP HMIs (+XDesignerPlus).</p>

                      <div class="jobYears">2017, Saran, Kazakhstan</div>
                      <p>Filled with blind student enthusiasm, I came up with the idea of modernization. The idea was born when I was once again wiping the oil flowed out of a gearbox in our electrical cabinet. The gearbox provided the twisting pitch of the twisted pair of the network cable. I wanted to exclude it from the mechanism and provide the twist pitch using the AI/AO reference between VFDs. I made a reference between 4 VFDs, tuned the PID, tuned the vector control (what a surprise it was for me that the motor cannot move a full drum of cable on 5 Hz without vector control). And... I failed. Without an encoder (which we did not have), it is impossible to get the precise pitch of the twist. It turned out that experienced Chinese designers are smarter than a student who did not have even a year of experience. But I have no regrets and got a great experience.<br><br>Technologies I worked with here: YASKAWA VFDs V1000 series (+DriveWizard).</p>
